    "If, elif & else are the stalwarts of control flow. Control flow is how we evaluate forks and choices in our program. If a value is equal to a condition we want to meet then do the following operation... else do some other operation. To enrich that basic construct we can add the `elif` option and subsequently allow if condition is True do some operation, elif (else if) some other condition is true do that operation instead, else do a default operation. You can see in the last example descriptor else becomes a default option and that's the else case's typical usage in a if, elif, else block, the last catching statement to do some default option/operation. \n",

    "In python we use the whitespace and indentation (typically 4 spaces) to lay out these statements. \n",

    "    do_this_default_action  \n",
