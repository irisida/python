Welcome to the python language repository. This repo is the lessons and notes taken, consumed and regurgitated for personal refrerence from many other available knowledge bases. If you have stumbled here and are having a sniff around I hope you find the notes of sime use, not too bloaty or without some context to the snippets and examples found in the notebooks. 

Most resources are typically laid out fairly siumilarly, section 1 what is python and where to find it, section two how to install it, tghe more adventurous might even tackle anaconda, conda, pyenv, virtual env. I am making no such assumptions, nor am I even attempting to bring something new to the realm. If you're here chances are I'm not your first dance with python, you're probably already installed and setup and if not then there are a million brilliant walkthroughs the tap of a 'return key' once you've entered "Setup python for programming" into a google search bar. 

With that cleared up, this repo is ordered in the following fashion: 

- Section Three: Python Objects & Data Structure basics
    - 3.01 Introduction to Python Data Types
    - 3.02 Python Numbers
    - 3.03 Variables and Variable assignment
    - 3.04 Introduction to Strings
    - 3.05 Strings: Indexing and Slicing
    - 3.06 String Methods
    - 3.07 Lists
    - 3.08 Dictionaries
    - 3.09 Tuples
    - 3.10 Booleans
    - 3.11 Basic file I/O
